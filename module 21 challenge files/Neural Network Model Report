Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model

Results:

Data Preprocessing:

Target Variable:

The target variable for the model is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column, representing whether a funding application was successful (1) or not (0).

Features:

Features for the model include various financial and organizational metrics such as "APPLICATION_TYPE," "AFFILIATION," and "INCOME_AMT."

Variable Removal:

Variables like "EIN" and "NAME" were removed as they did not contribute to predicting success and were not relevant features.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:

Neurons, Layers, and Activation Functions:

The model was designed with multiple layers, including densely connected layers with varying numbers of neurons. ReLU activation functions were used for hidden layers, and a sigmoid function for the output layer to perform binary classification.

Target Model Performance:

The target model performance was achieved with a satisfactory accuracy and minimal loss on the validation set.

Steps to Increase Model Performance:

Adjustments were made to the number of layers and neurons, and different activation functions were experimented with. Regularization techniques, such as dropout layers, were implemented to prevent overfitting.

Summary:

The deep learning model displayed promising results in predicting funding application success for Alphabet Soup. It achieved the desired target model performance with a well-balanced set of features. To further optimize the model, future iterations could explore advanced architectures or ensemble methods. Considering the complexity of the problem, a gradient boosting algorithm like XGBoost could provide an alternative solution, offering interpretability and potential improvements in performance. Regular model evaluations and updates are recommended to ensure ongoing effectiveness in predicting funding outcomes.
